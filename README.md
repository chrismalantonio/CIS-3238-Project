# CIS-3238-Project
This is a Java program that allows the user play either Blackjack or Gofish. 
The user is presented with a menu when the application starts that lets them
choose which game to start. The user will then play the game against an AI 
player(Blackjack), or multiple AI players(gofish).

Our project shows the starting game menu and then opens up the respective
game window depending on what the user clicks. You can test this by cloning our project
and running the "gameMain.java" file in the "gameWindow" package. We also have a testing 
package that has all the tests running correctly. 

Click on the Gofish button in the main menu to play Gofish or the help button to read the rules 
before playing. Click on the Blackjack button to choose whether to play as a Dealer or a Player and then choose 
your preferred role.
